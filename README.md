# F1-Penetration-Test
Between August 31 and September 7, 2024, a penetration test was conducted at F1 International Academy. This assessment involved public and internal reconnaissance, vulnerability scans, credential harvesting, social engineering, and on-site evaluations. While the environment showed several strong security measures that successfully detected, prevented, or mitigated various attack vectors, our team identified and provided mitigations for 22 vulnerabilities related to administrative systems, financial systems, and employee security practices.
